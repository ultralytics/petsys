# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the official Ultralytics repository dedicated to analyzing gamma scatter interactions on Lutetium‚ÄìYttrium Oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystals. This project leverages Ultralytics' expertise in data-driven research to advance understanding in [particle physics](https://home.cern/science/physics) and imaging technology.

## üìú Description

Our goal is to push the boundaries of particle detection and imaging. This repository, [Ultralytics PETSYS](https://github.com/ultralytics/petsys), focuses on the detailed analysis of gamma scatter phenomena observed on LYSO crystals coupled with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The dataset originates from PETSYS electronics in Lisbon, Portugal, collected in 2017. It forms the basis for our algorithms designed to perform energy calibration and assess the timing resolution of these sophisticated detection systems, crucial for applications like Positron Emission Tomography (PET).

## üì¶ Requirements

To explore the intricacies of scintillation and photo-detection with our tools, you'll need specific software and toolboxes. Ensure you have [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or newer installed. Additionally, certain MATLAB toolboxes focused on statistical analysis and signal processing are required.

Get started by:

1.  Cloning our common functions repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
    ```
2.  Adding the repository path to your MATLAB environment:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab')) % Replace /path/to/ with the actual directory
    ```
3.  Ensuring the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed:
    - `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
    - `Signal Processing Toolbox`

With these prerequisites met, you're ready for high-fidelity analysis!

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Code

Initiating the analysis is simple. Execute the following command in your MATLAB console:

```matlab
testSingles  % This script starts the analysis of the gamma scatter dataset
```

The script will generate graphical outputs and insights, including visualizations like the one shown below:
