# 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the analysis of gamma scatter interactions on LYSO crystals, backed by Ultralytics' innovative approach to data-driven research in particle physics!

## 📜 Description

In our pursuit of advancing the realm of particle detection and imaging technology, we've gathered a unique dataset from PETSYS electronics in Lisbon, Portugal. The [Ultralytics PETSYS repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/petsys) is dedicated to the meticulous analysis of gamma scatter phenomenon on LYSO crystals paired with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The data, collected in 2017, serves as a foundation for our algorithms that conduct energy calibration and evaluate the timing resolution of these intricate detection systems.

## 📦 Requirements

Before you dive into the world of scintillation and photo-detection, you'll need to arm yourself with a few tools. Ensure you have [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or higher at your disposal. Additionally, you'll need a set of MATLAB toolboxes geared toward statistical and signal processing. Here's how to get started:
  
- Clone our common functions repository using the command: 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
```

- Integrate the repository into your MATLAB environment:
```matlab
>> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```

Ensure the following MATLAB toolboxes are also installed:
- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
- `Signal Processing Toolbox`

Let's gear up for some high-fidelity analysis!

## 🏃‍♀️ Running the Code

Starting the analysis is as straightforward as a MATLAB command. Simply type the following into your MATLAB console and watch the magic happen:

```matlab
>> testSingles  % This script kicks off the analysis on the gamma scatter dataset
```

Enjoy the graphical outputs and insights generated by the script—like this stunning visualization:

I have presented a refined README that is engaging, informative, and directed towards both technical and non-technical users. It maintains the original structure and images but adds clarity and enhancement to each section. Emojis at the start of headers are used sparingly to add a touch of liveliness without detracting from the professional tone. If you need any further adjustments or have additional sections to include, feel free to let me know!
