# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to our project! This repository contains advanced analytical software crafted with care by [Ultralytics LLC](http://www.ultralytics.com/projects). We specialize in turning data into insights and are eager to share our work with the community.

# üìú Description

The [Ultralytics PETSYS analysis repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/petsys) provides a detailed examination of gamma-ray scattering events in LYSO crystals coupled with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The dataset explored herein was meticulously gathered at PETSYS Electronics S.A. facilities in Lisbon, Portugal, throughout 2017. Our MATLAB codebase is designed to conduct a thorough energy calibration and measure the timing resolution of these fascinating gamma interactions.

# üì¶ Requirements

Before diving into the gamma-ray analysis, you'll need to prepare your environment. This project has been developed in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), and it is essential to have version 2018a or newer. 

Ensure that you have also cloned the common functions repository with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
```

After cloning, add it to your MATLAB path:

```matlab
>> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```

This project relies on specific MATLAB toolboxes:
- **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox**
- **Signal Processing Toolbox**

# üö¥ Running the Analysis

To kickstart the analysis, simply execute the following in MATLAB:

```matlab
>> testSingles
```

As the process unfolds, you will observe results similar to the image below, illustrating the level of precision achieved through our analysis.
