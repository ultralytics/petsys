# üìú Introduction

Welcome to the Ultralytics `petsys` repository! This repository is the hub for our extensive analysis on the behavior of gamma scatters on inorganic LYSO crystals, an important component in the development of advanced medical imaging devices such as PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scanners. The data for this study was meticulously gathered at the state-of-the-art PETSYS labs in Lisbon, Portugal.

# üì¶ Description

This repository is dedicated to processing and analyzing data captured from gamma scatters on LYSO crystals coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). Collected in 2017, this dataset offers a rich source of information pivotal for advancing research in medical imaging technology. The provided MATLAB code focuses on energy calibration and timing resolution analysis, enabling researchers to extract meaningful insights from complex data patterns more efficiently.

# üõ† Requirements

To utilize this repository, you will need [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or newer. Ensure you have access to the following resources:

- Clone our common functions repository using the command:
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
  ```
- Add it to the MATLAB path with:
  ```matlab
  >> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
  ```
  
Additionally, your MATLAB installation should have these toolboxes installed:
- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
- `Signal Processing Toolbox`

# üîß Running the Analysis

To run the single-event analysis:
1. Open MATLAB.
2. In the MATLAB Command Window, type:
    ```matlab
    >> testSingles
    ```
   This script will initiate the processing of the data and provide output on the energy calibration and timing resolution from the data set.
