# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the analysis of gamma scatter interactions on LYSO crystals, backed by Ultralytics' innovative approach to data-driven research in particle physics!

[![Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/petsys/actions/workflows/format.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultralytics/petsys/actions/workflows/format.yml)

## üìú Description

In our pursuit of advancing the realm of particle detection and imaging technology, we've gathered a unique dataset from PETSYS electronics in Lisbon, Portugal. The [Ultralytics PETSYS repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/petsys) is dedicated to the meticulous analysis of gamma scatter phenomenon on LYSO crystals paired with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The data, collected in 2017, serves as a foundation for our algorithms that conduct energy calibration and evaluate the timing resolution of these intricate detection systems.

## üì¶ Requirements

Before you dive into the world of scintillation and photo-detection, you'll need to arm yourself with a few tools. Ensure you have [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or higher at your disposal. Additionally, you'll need a set of MATLAB toolboxes geared toward statistical and signal processing. Here's how to get started:

- Clone our common functions repository using the command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
```

- Integrate the repository into your MATLAB environment:

```matlab
>> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```

Ensure the following MATLAB toolboxes are also installed:

- `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`
- `Signal Processing Toolbox`

Let's gear up for some high-fidelity analysis!

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Code

Starting the analysis is as straightforward as a MATLAB command. Simply type the following into your MATLAB console and watch the magic happen:

```matlab
>> testSingles  % This script kicks off the analysis on the gamma scatter dataset
```

Enjoy the graphical outputs and insights generated by the script‚Äîlike this stunning visualization:
